# To configure this workflow:
#
# https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/github-actions/tree/docs/service-account-key/setup-gcloud#inputs
# 1. Set up secrets in your workspace: GKE_PROJECT with the name of the project,
#    SA_EMAIL with the service account email, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS with
#    the Base64 encoded JSON service account key.
#
# 2. Change the values for the GKE_ZONE, GKE_CLUSTER and IMAGE environment variables (below).
